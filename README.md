How to Run: Download the .zip file containing the 5 files. put the .h file, .txt file, and two .cpp files into a project together. Then, simply run the main file.

Dependencies: none

Group Members: Dylan Edwards, Andrew Wesselhoff

Contributors: Dylan Edwards, Andrew Wesselhoff, Jacob Grunwald, Conor Parrish, XuanZhou, Owen Wattenmaker

Open Issues/bugs: The SortbyRating method only swaps the title and the rating, not the entire node.
                  If one of the top 10 movies is deleted, it will only print out 9 movies.
